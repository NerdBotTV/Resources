# Song Filters
NerdBot's song filters are split into two categories, depending on how tolerant the streamer is.

### [offensive.json](offensive.json)
Extremely offensive songs. Includes racist songs, "ear rape," etc.

### [troll.json](troll.json)
"Troll" songs. Not as offensive, but not "real" songs either.
