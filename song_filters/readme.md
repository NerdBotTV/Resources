# Song Filters
NerdBot's song filters are split into two categories, depending on how tolerant the streamer is.

### "[Offensive](offensive.json)"
These songs are offensive. Examples include racist songs, "ear rape," and other extremely offensive songs.

### "[Troll](troll.json)"
These songs are simply "troll" songs. They are not as offensive, but most streamers would not like having them requested.
