# Song Filters
Nerdbot's song filters are split into two categories, depending on how tolerant the streamer is.

### [normal.json](normal.json)
'Normal' filter - extremely offensive songs. Includes racist songs, "ear rape," etc.

### [strict.json](strict.json)
'Strict' filter - not as offensive, but not "real" songs either.
